# ndsr-2016-bagit
Currently defined in an IETF draft, the [BagIt specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-08) is used by many libraries, archives, and systems nationwide for secure transfer of digital content. Some in the digital preservation field have questions about what scenarios may benefit from BagIt, and for this session, Kathryn Gronsbell will lead a discussion about this widely used file packaging format and how to use it during a basic, hands-on tutorial. 

Materials in this repo provide supplemental and installation information related to the [in-person event on April 28, 2016](http://ndsr.nycdigital.org/ndsrsymposium/) at the Brooklyn Historical Society in Brooklyn, NY.
